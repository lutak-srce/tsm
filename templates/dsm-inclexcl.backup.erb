*  INCLUDE/EXCLUDE options for Linux clients
*
*  EXCLUDE
*  EXCLUDE.BACKUP
*  EXCLUDE.FILE
*  EXCLUDE.FILE.BACKUP
*
*  These options are equivalent. Use these options to exclude a file or
*  group of files from backup services and space management services
*  (if the HSM client is installed). The exclude.backup option only
*  excludes files from normal backup, but not from HSM.
*
*
*  EXCLUDE.FS excludes a single file system from backup processing

exclude.fs /tmp

*  EXCLUDE.ATTRIBUTE.SYMLINK excludes a file or a group of files that
*  are symbolic links from backup processing only

*  EXCLUDE.ARCHIVE excludes a file or a group of files that match the
*  pattern from archive services only
*
*  EXCLUDE.BACKUP excludes a file or a group of files that match the
*  pattern from backup services only
*
*  EXCLUDE.DIR excludes a directory, its files, and all its
*  subdirectories and their files from backup processing

* Default backup INCLUDE/EXCLUDE options

exclude.archive /tmp
exclude.backup  /tmp
exclude.archive /var/run/*
exclude.backup  /var/run/*
exclude.archive /var/tmp/*
exclude.backup  /var/tmp/*
exclude.dir /tmp
